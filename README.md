# Walker #84837's Linktree

This is the GitHub repo for my Linktree page, based on [John Emerson](https://github.com/johnggli)'s Linktree page\*.

\* Since I didn't know about licenses back when I personalized this website, and I forgot who originally made this, and checked GitHub and saw it was an MIT License, so I just added credits.

Aside from everything, there is nothing much to say about this repo.
